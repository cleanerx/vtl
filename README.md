# Virtual Transport Layer (VTL)
Virtual Transport Layer, a protocol deployment management system aiming
(1) to dynamically deploy protocol mechanisms/components, in order
(2) to ensure optimal data moving between end-points.

We are spending time bettering the implementation. Until now the focus has been
on correctness rather than performance. We will keep correctness, but we will
improve performance, especially in light of practical experience with
applications. Suggestions are welcome.
