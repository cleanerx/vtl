# Virtual Transport Layer (VTL)
Virtual Transport Layer, a protocol deployment management system aiming
(1) to dynamically deploy protocol mechanisms/components, in order
(2) to ensure optimal data moving between end-points.

I am spending time bettering the implementation. Until now the focus has been
on the correctness rather than performance. I will keep correctness, but I will
improve performance, especially in light of practical experience with
applications. Suggestions are welcome.
